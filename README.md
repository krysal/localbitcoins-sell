# Localbitcoins Selling Dashboard

Sort all bitcoin selling ads in Venezuelan Bol√≠var (VES) posted on [Localbitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/) from highest to lowest offer, filter by Bank and desired amount to sell.

## TODO
- [X] Add BTC/USD/VES rates
- [ ] Add **Others** in banks options
- [X] Get all the ads (pagination)
- [X] Fix CORS problem (meanwhile it requires this [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino) to work)
- [X] Remove unwanted ads like those with too low amounts, no bank transfer like payment method (recharges, cupones, etc)
- [X] Refresh ads list with button
- [X] Add animated spinner while loading data
- [X] Add scroll back to top button
- [ ] Add words to exclude entered by user
